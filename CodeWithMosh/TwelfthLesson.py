# machine Learning in action
#import data
# clean data
# split into twos sets, 1)training(80%) 2)testing(20%)
# create a model(select alogirthm like decision trees , neural n/ws). Already built in scikitlearn
# train the model (look for pattersn)
# make predictions
# evaluate prediction and measure the accuracy to improve
# select new algorithm, or fine tune parameters to improve accuracy


#libraries and tools
# numpy -multidimensional arrays
# pandas-data analysisis library which provides data frame which is a 2d data structure similar to excel with rows and columns
# matplotlib-2d plotting library
# scikit-learn popular machine learning library with algoritms
# we use jupyter environment, easy for ML projects
# to install jupyter we use anaconda platform (anaconda.com), install anaconda for python 3.7
# https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
# anaconda install pouplar libraries as well, like numpy pandas etc..
# skip vscode install as already installed
# open terminal and type jupyter notebook to start the notebook server on our machine
# automatically opens browser windows that opens local host with port 8888 (this is jupyter dashboard)
# go to desktop , craete new python3 notebook
# change name from untitled
# extension will be saved with .ipynb
# click run to run code


# importing  a dataset
# we will download from kaggle.com
# signup on kaggle
# in search f, search for video game sales, by gregory smith, analyze sales of 16500 video games
# download data set, it will be a zip file, extract the zip and place the .csv in same location as your notebook

# rest continued in TwelfthJupyter Folder .ipynb files
